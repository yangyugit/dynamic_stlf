# A dynamic ensemble method 
This code is possible to create a dynamic ensemble method for most modelling and forecasting problem. Here, we present a residential short-term load forecasting example. 

## getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
### Prerequisites
You just need MATLAB. This code has been developed on MATLAB R2021b, but should also be compatible with earlier versions. But, to accelerate the training of the deep learning neural network, you should need a GPU. 

### Installing 
The installation in MATLAB is rather simple. Download the file and unzip it, then run the .m code.
